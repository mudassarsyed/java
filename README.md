## Getting Started

BrowserStack supports Selenium automated tests using Cucumber, and running your tests on our cloud setup is simple and straightforward. Get started with a sample test, which opens Google's homepage, searches for ‘BrowserStack’, and asserts for the title of the search results page. For the code to run successfully on your machine, please ensure that the following libraries have been installed:

```
#Install using gem
gem install cucumber
```
